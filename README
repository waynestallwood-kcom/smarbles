A silly Marbles game for testing import of AWS icons into Unity3D

Just load the contents of this repo as a project in Unity3D > 4.0
All assets included, just build from the project on first go

Most of the game logic is in the player controller script.
Go to the player object in the project hierarchy in unity to set time left and player speed.
